		<div class="title">Rainfall</div>
		<div class="text">
			<div class="paragraph"> I moved to the Bay in the summer of 2013, and I really thought that all of California was just always sunny. All through summer and fall, the sun was out all the time. Then came the winter, and all it did was rain. Yet we were in a drought. So I started doing my own research. </div>
			<div class="paragraph">I was fascinated by the fact that there's a dry season and a wet season. I was also interested in our steady decrease of water supplies. So I wanted to capture all of this in a graphic.</div>
			<div class="paragaraph">Below is the latest iteration of the graphic that shows the amount of rainfall in downtown SF for the past 115 months (or almost 10 years). What I particularly liked about this graphic is that the presentation of the data represents the actual subject of the data: each data point is represented in a "raindrop". At the top of the graph is the sky, and the farther a raindrop is from the top, the more rain there was that month. Because of the natural grouping of the raindrops, you can quickly tell that there's a wetter season and a drier season. You can also tell that because there are more raindrops closer to the top, that we have more drier months than wetter months, thus the drought.  each each piece of dataI can't say that this hits exactly what I want, so come back in a week or so, and perhaps this graph will look different.</div>
			<div class="paragraph"> There are many iterations of the graphic below, with explanations for why I scrapped the each idea. </div>
			<div class="paragraph"> The data came from <a href="http://www.cnrfc.noaa.gov/rainfall_data.php">here</a>. </div>
