		<div class="text">
		<div class="paragraph">Teachers call parents all the time, and after hanging up the phone, these calls are logged in a notebook or binder to help teachers remember what the call was about (especially when you have 150 kids). You&rsquo;re probably thinking, &ldquo;How antiquated!&rdquo; And that&rsquo;s why we designed Dash4Teachers, which was an iPhone app that allowe teachers to call and record conversations without the hassle of switching between phone and paper. Dash4Teachers was made for teachers to not only record conversations, but also for teachers to track which numbers are best to use as well as the best times to call. </div>
		<div class="paragraph">I joined the team as the web designer and developer during the summer between my first and second years of teaching. </div>
		<div class="paragraph">Unfortunately, because the whole team has full-time jobs, we have pulled the app off the Apple store since September last year, so the website no longer exists as well. Below are just some screenshots. The code lives here on Git.</div>
