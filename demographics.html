		<div class="title">Changing Demographics</div>
		<div class="text">
			<div class="paragraph"> I teach in low-income community in East Bay, and my school is a third Hispanic, a third black, and a third Asian. I don't see the same demographic composition where I live in Mountain View, so I became fascinated by the racial breakdown in the different regions of the Bay. As I started doing research, I was amazed by how quickly the demographic composition of the Bay has changed within the last 70 years (especially the last 20), and I wanted to capture this in the graphic. </div>
			<div class="paragaraph">I took data from the <a href="http://www.bayareacensus.ca.gov/bayarea.htm">Bay Area Census</a>, organized it in Excel, then made the graphic in Illustrator. </div>

		<div class="text">
			<div class="paragraph">Since what piqued my interest in making this visualization in the first place was the demographic makeup of my school, I knew that I wanted the data to show the ethnicity breakdown of the population. Circle graph made the most sense for to show the percentage breakdown.</div>
			<div class="paragraph">As explained above, as I mined the data, I was blown away by how quickly the racial distribution shifted within the past 60 years, so I also wanted to capture this in the visualization. I felt the circle graphs focused too much on the demographic breakdown and not enough on the changes of the population. I also felt that the circles could be more compacted together to be more space efficient.

		</div>		
		<div class="text">
			<div class="paragraph">I still wanted circle graphs because they showed percentages best, but I also wanted to display the population changes over time. As I laid the circles on top of each other, I got the idea to make the circles into rings. The rings would still show the percent, but each of the rings could then represent a year, which would show the changes in the population through the years.</div>

			<div class="paragraph">What started my whole interest was how the population looked different throughout different parts of the Bay, so I wanted to capture this on a map.

		</div>
		<div class="text">
			<div class="paragraph">I also wanted to show the signficiant differences in the number of people that live in each of the counties becaused I noticed that there is a correlation between the size of the population and the amount of diverity within the county. This is why I overlaid the transparent circles on top of the rings to show the populations of the counties. </div>

		</div>		
		<div class="text">
			<div class="paragraph">Because the Bay Area counties are already irregularly shaped, the transparent overlays on top of the map made the visualization harder to read. I instead chose to use a dotted line to show the current population of each of the counties. The dotted line differentiates itself from the rest of the rings. It is also much cleaner than the transparent circle. </div>

		<div class="text">
			<div class="paragraph">There are still several parts that I'm revisiting on the visualization. One of the main things I'm wondering about is if there is another way to show the map of the Bay Area. Because the shape of the counties are so irregular, I think it may be difficult for readers to orient themselves and see that this is a map of the Bay. </div>
