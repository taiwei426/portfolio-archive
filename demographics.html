		<div class="title">Changing Demographics</div>
		<div class="text">
			<div class="paragraph"> I teach in low-income community in East Bay, and my school is a third Hispanic, a third black, and a third Asian. I don't see the same demographic composition where I live, so I became fascinated by the racial breakdown in the different regions of the Bay. As I started doing research, I was amazed by how quickly the demographic composition in the area changed within the last 70 years (especially the last 20), and I wanted to capture this in the graphic. </div>
			<div class="paragaraph">I took data from the <a href="http://www.bayareacensus.ca.gov/bayarea.htm">Bay Area Census</a>, organized it in Excel, then made the graphic in Illustrator. </div>

		</div>
		<div class="text">
			<div class="paragraph">Since what piqued my interest in making this visualization in the first place was the demographic makeup of my school, I knew that I wanted the data to show the ethnicity breakdown of the population. Circle graph made the most sense for to show the percentage breakdown.</div>
			<div class="paragraph">As I graphed everything in circle graphs though, I also thought it was interesting to see the population shifts as some races grew and some shrunk. I felt the circles focused too much on the demographic breakdown ...I wanted to show was the demographic change through the years, not necessarily the demographic breakdown of each of the years. I felt that the circles could be more compacted together to be more space efficient.
